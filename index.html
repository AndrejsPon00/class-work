            What is Sass? That's the question we here to answer. If you're new to web design, you've probably heard the
            term floating around, but you might not be quite up to speed with exactly what Sass is, what is does, and
            whether or not you should be using it. In short, Sass is a CSS preprocessor, which adds special features
            such as variables, nested rules and mixins (sometimes referred to as syntactic sugar) into regular CSS. The
            aim is to make the coding process simpler and more efficient. Let's explore in more detail.

        <h4 class="font-18px bold">What is a CSS preprocessor?</h4>
        <span class="font-12px">
            A CSS preprocessor is a scripting language that extends CSS by allowing developers to write code in one
            language and then compile it into CSS. Sass is perhaps the most popular preprocessor around right now, but
            other well-known examples include Less and Stylus.
            <br><br>
            Before we go any further, a quick public service announcement is in order: most web designers would say that
            if you're new to CSS, you're better off avoiding Sass (or any preprocessors, extensions or frameworks) while
            you're still learning. While it's true they offer many advantages in speed and efficiency, it's important
            that you really get to grips with the basics of CSS. Make sure you learn the core concepts before you start
            exploring shortcuts and confusing things.
        </span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">What is Sass?</h4>
        <span class="font-12px bold">Sass is arguably the most useful of all CSS extensions</span>
        <span class="font-12px">
            <br>
            Sass (which stands for 'Syntactically awesome style sheets) is an extension of CSS that enables you to use
            things like variables, nested rules, inline imports and more. It also helps to keep things organised and
            allows you to create style sheets faster.
            <br><br>
            Sass is compatible with all versions of CSS. The only requirement for using it is that you must have Ruby
            installed. Users are also asked to follow the Sass Community Guidelines.
            How to use Sass
            <br><br>
            In the following section, we'll outline some basic tips for using Sass, using examples from the official
            Sass website. Take a look at the Sass Documentation for additional references and examples.
        </span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Syntax</h4>
        <span class="font-12px bold">Sass includes two syntax options:</span>
        <ul>
            <li class="font-12px">
                SCSS (Sassy CSS): Uses the .scss file extension and is fully compliant with CSS syntax
            </li>
            <li class="font-12px">Indented (simply called 'Sass'): Uses .sass file extension and indentation rather than
                brackets; it isnot fully compliant with CSS syntax, but it's quicker to write
            </li>
        </ul>
        <span class="font-12px italic"> Note that files can be converted from one syntax to the other using the
            sass-convert command.</span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Variables</h4>
        <span class="font-12px">Just like other programming languages, Sass allows the use of variables that can store
            information you can use throughout your style sheet. For example, you can store a colour value in a variable
            at the top of the file, and then use this variable when setting the colour of your elements. This enables
            you to quickly change your colours without having to modify each line separately.
        </span>
        <p class="font-12px bold">For example:</p>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            $font-stack: Helvetica, sans-serif; <br> $primary-color: #333; <br><br>
            body {<br>&nbsp;font: 100% $font-stack;<br>&nbsp;color: $primary-color;<br>}<br><br>
            The following CSS will be produced:<br><br>
            body {<br>&nbsp;font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>&nbsp; color: #333;<br>}<br><br>
        </span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Nesting</h4>
        <span class="font-12px ">
            Nesting is a double-edged sword. While it provides an excellent method for reducing the amount of code you
            need to write, it can also lead to over-qualified CSS if not executed carefully. The idea is to nest your
            CSS selectors in such a way as to mimic your HTML hierarchy.
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px"><br>The following shows a basic navigation style that uses nesting:<br><br></span>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            nav {<br>&nbspul {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;margin: 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;padding: 0;<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;list-style:
            none;<br>}<br><br>
            li {<br>&nbsp; display: inline-block; <br>}<br><br>
            a {<br>&nbsp;display: block;<br>&nbsp;padding: 6px 12px;<br>&nbsp;text-decoration: none;<br>}<br>}
        </span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">The CSS output is as follows:</h4>
        <span class="font-12px">
            nav ul {<br>
            &nbsp; margin: 0;<br>
            &nbsp; padding: 0;<br>
            &nbsp; list-style: none;<br>
            }<br><br>
            nav li {<br>
            &nbsp; display: inline-block;<br>
            }<br><br>
            nav a {<br>
            &nbsp; display: block;<br>
            &nbsp; padding: 6px 12px;<br>
            &nbsp; text-decoration: none;<br>
            }<br>
        </span>

        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Partials</h4>
        <span class="font-12px">
            Partials are smaller Sass files that can be imported (see next section) into other Sass files. Think of
            partials as code snippets. With these code snippets, your CSS can now be modular and easier to maintain. A
            partial is designated as such by naming it with a leading underscore: _partial.scss. <br><br>
            Used with Partials (see previous section), the @import directive allows you to import your partial files
            into the current file, to build one single CSS file. Be mindful of how many imports you're using as an HTTP
            request will be generated for each one.<br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            html,<br>
            body,<br>
            ul,<br>
            ol {<br>
            &nbsp; margin: 0;<br>
            &nbsp; padding: 0;<br>
            }<br><br>
            // basefile.scss<br><br>
            @import 'reset';<br><br>
            body {<br>
            &nbsp; font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
            &nbsp; background-color: #efefef;<br>
            }
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            html, body, ul, ol {<br>
            &nbsp; margin: 0;<br>
            &nbsp; padding: 0;<br>
            }<br><br>
            body {<br>
            &nbsp; font: 100% Helvetica, sans-serif;<br>
            &nbsp; background-color: #efefef;<br>
            }
        </span>

        <span class="font-12px">
            <br><br>
            Note: When importing partials, you don't need to include the file extension or the underscore.
        </span>


        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Mixins</h4>
        <span class="font-12px bold">
            One of the advantages of using preprocessors is their ability to take complex, long-winded code and simplify
            it. This is where mixins come in handy!<br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px">For example, if you need to include the vendor prefixes, you can use a mixin instead.
            Take a look at this
            example for border-radius:<br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            @mixin border-radius($radius) {<br>
            &nbsp; -webkit-border-radius: $radius;<br>
            &nbsp; -moz-border-radius: $radius;<br>
            &nbsp; -ms-border-radius: $radius;<br>
            &nbsp; border-radius: $radius;<br>
            }<br><br>
            .box { @include border-radius(10px); }<br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px">
            Notice the @mixin directive at the top. It has been given the name border-radius and uses the variable
            $radius as its parameter. This variable is used to set the radius value for each element<br><br>
        </span>
        <span class="font-12px">
            Later, the @include directive is called, along with the mixin name (border-radius) and a parameter (10px).
            Thus .box { @include border-radius(10px); }.
        </span>
        <p class="font-12px bold">The following CSS is produced:</p>
        <span class="font-12px italic">
            .box {<br>
            &nbsp; -webkit-border-radius: 10px;<br>
            &nbsp; -moz-border-radius: 10px;<br>
            &nbsp; -ms-border-radius: 10px;<br>
            &nbsp; border-radius: 10px;<br>
            }
        </span>
        <h4 class="font-18px bold">Extend/Inheritance</h4>
        <span class="font-12px">
            The @extend directive has been called one of Sass' most powerful features. After seeing it in action, it's
            clear why.<br><br>
            The idea is that with this directive you won't have to include multiple class names on your HTML elements
            and can keep your code DRY (don't repeat yourself). Your selectors can inherit the styles of other
            selectors, and then be easily extended when required. Now that's powerful.<br><br>
            Having the ability to perform calculations in your CSS allows you to do more, like convert pixel values into
            percentages. You'll have access to standard maths functions like addition, subtraction, multiplication and
            division. Of course, these functions can be combined to create complex calculations.<br><br>
            In addition, Sass includes a few built-in functions to help manipulate numbers. Functions like percentage(),
            floor() and round() to name a few.
